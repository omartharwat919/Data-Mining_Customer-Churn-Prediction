# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction - Data Mining Project

This project applies data mining techniques to predict customer churn using the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm.  
It aims to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn or not based on historical data and behavioral patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** Naive Bayes
- **Type:** Supervised Learning - Classification
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes / No)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features such as:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Service usage (internet, phone, streaming)
- Monthly charges, total charges
- Churn label (target variable)

---

## ✅ Results Summary

- Model accuracy: 97%
- Top indicators of churn: Contract type, Monthly Charges, Tenure.
